# DKD: Deep Krishi Development

## Concept Overview

This idea is inspired by the mathematical concept of Sequence and Series. Just like exponential growth, the dairy farming model will follow a doubling pattern every year. It starts with an initial set of 100 buffalo and scales up through their natural calving process.

## Phase 1: Dairy Farming

- Start with **100 buffalo** in one shelter (tabela).
- Sell their milk to generate profit.
- Use the profit to manage their fodder (chaara) and chokar (cattle feed).
- Every year, due to calving, each tabela will double in number:
  - Year 1: 1 tabela (100 buffalo)
  - Year 2: 2 tabela (200 buffalo)
  - Year 3: 4 tabela (400 buffalo)
  - Year 4: 8 tabela (800 buffalo)
  - ...
- Every year, new buffalos will be put in new shelters to maintain balance and health and when the overall turnover becomes 200 carore then i will adopt all the street cows and bulls and put them in gaushala.

## Phase 2: Animal Welfare

- Once the business generates **â‚¹200 Crore** profit:
  - Start rescuing stray cows and bulls from the streets.
  - Provide them shelter and care.
  - Treat and adopt them as family.

## Phase 3: Organic Farming

- Once there is enough cow dung (gobar), start organic farming on the agreed farming lands.
- Partner with landowners and utilize farming land sustainably.
- Hire **landless and illiterate laborers** to provide them employment and uplift their livelihoods.
- Organic farming will preserve soil fertility and prevent the land from turning barren.

## Spiritual Vision

I am a spiritual person and deeply love Narayan. Cows are very dear to Narayan, and protecting them is not just a social mission but a sacred duty for me and mahadev also like nandi most so because of this i want to adopt bulls for cultivation because i am a big devote of mahadev also. This divine connection is also a major reason why I am committed to cow protection.

## Mission

To build a sustainable, scalable and compassionate farming ecosystem that grows naturally, creates employment, and takes care of both animals and humans.
